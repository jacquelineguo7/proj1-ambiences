# First Person Template

For USC course CTIN 406: Sound Design for Games.

Based on Unity's [Starter Assets: First Person](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-firstperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196525) package.

This project contains a Playground scene with a first-person character controller as well as Wwise integration. It's provided as a jumping point for your own projects, but you're not required to use it.

It also doesn't contain any audio scripts or functionality; for audio references you may want to look at the [Roll-A-Ball-With-Audio](https://github.com/CTIN-406-Sound-Design-for-Games/RollABallWithAudio-Spring2026) project.
